About the Plugin:
The plugin is completely my own coding.

This plugin was made with all settings configurable config.

What the plugin does:
Slot 9 (Hotbar's Latest Slot) Will Be An Item In This Slot. You will enter the menu with it and buy an arrow. However, the arrow you received will not arrive in your hand or in your inventory. However, when you receive a bow in your hand, an arrow will come in Slot 9. But of course if there is unlimited mode, but if unlimited mode is off, arrow 9 will also be arrow.
